# Bluetooth Delay for Kodi
## script.bluetooth.delay
This addon makes it easy to use Kodi with bluetooth headphones.

With this addon you can set up Audio Delay for one or two devices, and toggle between them via a shortcut on your home screen, or a shortcut on your keyboard.

You can download and install the repo from here [https://mhr-official.github.io](https://mhr-official.github.io)

To set a keyboard shortcut:

* For toggle:    RunScript(script.bluetooth.delay)

* For device 1:  RunScript(script.bluetooth.delay,0)

* For device 2:  RunScript(script.bluetooth.delay,1)
